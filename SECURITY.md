# Security Policy

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in tucano (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can either:

- open a [GitHub security issue on the tucano project](https://github.com/tucano/tucano/security/advisories/new)
- reach us at <security@jointucano.org>

You should _not_ report such issues on public GitHub issues or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing tucano's users to increased risk.

## Scope

A "vulnerability in tucano" is a vulnerability in the code distributed through our main source code repository on GitHub. Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that installation and not us.
